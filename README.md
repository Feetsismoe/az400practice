Most simple docker container into azure web app i can think of.

TODO: 
- Clean up, comment and understand code in dockerfile
- Clean up pipeline in stages, parameters, variables, etc
- Refactor application in directory structure so that it can be expanded. 


Run image locally: 
docker run -dp 5000:80 <image><tag>
